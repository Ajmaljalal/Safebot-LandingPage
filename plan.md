   - FAQ section
   - Call-to-action section
   - Footer with links and legal information

## Step 3: CSS Styling
1. Implement a clean, modern design matching the app's aesthetic
2. Use CSS variables for consistent color application

6. Implement custom styling for buttons, forms, and UI components

## Step 4: JavaScript Functionality

3. Create any necessary interactive elements (tabs, accordions for FAQs)
4. Add subtle animations on scroll
5. Implement form validation for any contact or signup forms

## Step 5: Content Creation
1. Write compelling copy that clearly explains:

   - Pricing options ($9.99 one-time assessment, $4.99/month subscription)
2. Create or source appropriate images:
   - App screenshots
   - Security-related illustrations
   - Icons for features

## Step 6: Optimization
1. Optimize all images for web
2. Ensure fast loading times
3. Implement SEO best practices
4. Test for accessibility compliance
5. Ensure cross-browser compatibility

## Step 7: Testing
1. Test responsive behavior across different devices
2. Validate HTML and CSS
3. Check for any JavaScript errors
4. Test all interactive elements
5. Perform a final review of content and messaging

## Implementation Notes
- The landing page should emphasize both physical and cyber security aspects of the app
- Use security-related imagery and icons to reinforce the product's purpose
